I'm writing a mystery story. Here's a summary of what it involves:

{{summary}}

I want to have a true story of what happened when {{killer}} killed {{victim}}. This story won't be presented to the reader clearly, but I want to have it in my mind so that I can write the story with more depth and detail. I want to know what happened, why it happened, and how it happened. I want to know the killer's motive, the victim's personality, and the circumstances. The deed should not be obvious to other characters in the story, as befits a good murder mystery story.

Write a three paragraph story detailing how the killer killed the victim. Write nothing else, just a three paragraph story. Write clearly and stick to the facts, because this is for my notes, not for the reader.
