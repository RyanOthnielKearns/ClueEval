I'm writing a murder mystery story. I've written up my story in the form of some bullet points, and I want to organize them.

Analyze the following story and classify each piece of evidence (bullet point) according to how it relates to the hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime. For each bullet point, determine if it proves, suggests, suggests against, or proves against any hypothesis.

For example, if a bullet point shows a character picking up a knife, then that suggests that that character might be the killer.

I want to know whether each bullet point is suggestive or conclusive, and whether it suggests for or against. So here are the four categories which we might be able to classify a piece of evidence with.

* proves -- use this only if the evidence is conclusive proof
* suggests -- suggests that this character is the killer, or this location is where the murder occurred, but circumstantially
* suggests_against -- suggests that it isn't true
* proves_against -- conclusive proof that something isn't true

The hypothesis_type is what part of the story the bullet point relates to -- the killer, the location, or the murder weapon.

The hypothesis_name is the specific individual, like one of the characters who might be the killer, or one of the named locations.

# Story:

{bullet_points}

# Hypotheses:

Killers: {killers}
Weapons: {weapons}
Locations: {locations}

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{{
  "classified_evidence": [
    {{
      "text": "The butler was seen in the kitchen",
      "classifications": [
        {{
          "hypothesis_type": "killer/weapon/location/none",
          "hypothesis_name": "Name of the specific hypothesis or 'None' if not applicable",
          "category": "proves/suggests/suggests_against/proves_against/unrelated"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

# Important:

1. Include EVERY bullet point in the "classified_evidence" array.
2. For each bullet point, provide classifications for ALL relevant hypotheses it relates to.
3. If a bullet point doesn't relate to any specific hypothesis type, use "none" as the hypothesis_type and "None" as the hypothesis_name.
4. Use the categories "proves", "suggests", "suggests_against", "proves_against", or "unrelated" as appropriate.
5. Use the full text of the bullet point in the "text" field, not just an ID or number.

Example of a bullet point not related to any hypothesis:
{{
  "text": "The butler likes sandwiches",
  "classifications": [
    {{
      "hypothesis_type": "none",
      "hypothesis_name": "None",
      "category": "unrelated"
    }}
  ]
}}

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how each piece of evidence relates to the various hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime, or to indicate when a piece of evidence is unrelated to these hypotheses.
