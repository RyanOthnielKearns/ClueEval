I'm writing a murder mystery story. I've written up my story in the form of some bullet points, and I want to organize them.

Analyze the following story and classify each piece of evidence (bullet point) according to how it relates to the hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime. For each bullet point, determine if it proves, suggests, suggests against, or proves against any hypothesis.

I'm going to give you a list of facts about the story, and I want you to classify each of them according to the scheme I'm giving you.

Story:
{bullet_points}

Hypotheses:
Killers: {killers}
Weapons: {weapons}
Locations: {locations}

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{{
  "classified_evidence": [
    {{
      "bullet_point": "The full text of the bullet point",
      "classifications": [
        {{
          "hypothesis_type": "killer/weapon/location",
          "hypothesis_name": "Name of the specific hypothesis",
          "category": "proves/suggests/suggests_against/proves_against",
          "explanation": "A brief explanation of why this bullet point supports or opposes the hypothesis"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Important:
1. Include EVERY bullet point in the "classified_evidence" array.
2. For each bullet point, provide classifications for ALL relevant hypotheses it relates to.
3. If a bullet point doesn't relate to a specific hypothesis type, don't include a classification for that hypothesis type.
4. Use the categories "proves", "suggests", "suggests_against", or "proves_against" as appropriate.
5. Provide a brief explanation for each classification to justify the categorization.
6. Ensure that the full text of each bullet point is included in the "bullet_point" field.

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how each piece of evidence relates to the various hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime.
