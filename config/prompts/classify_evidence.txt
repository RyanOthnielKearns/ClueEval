I'm writing a murder mystery story. I've written up my story in the form of some bullet points, and I want to organize them.

Analyze the following story and classify each piece of evidence (bullet point) according to how it relates to the hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime. For each bullet point, determine if it proves, suggests, suggests against, or proves against any hypothesis.

I'm going to give you a list of facts about the story, and I want you to classify each of them according to the scheme I'm giving you.

# Story:

{bullet_points}

# Hypotheses:

Killers: {killers}
Weapons: {weapons}
Locations: {locations}

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{{
  "classified_evidence": [
    {{
      "text": "The butler was seen in the kitchen",
      "classifications": [
        {{
          "hypothesis_type": "killer/weapon/location/none",
          "hypothesis_name": "Name of the specific hypothesis or 'None' if not applicable",
          "category": "proves/suggests/suggests_against/proves_against/unrelated"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

# Important:

1. Include EVERY bullet point ID in the "classified_evidence" array.
2. For each bullet point, provide classifications for ALL relevant hypotheses it relates to.
3. If a bullet point doesn't relate to any specific hypothesis type, use "none" as the hypothesis_type and "None" as the hypothesis_name.
4. Use the categories "proves", "suggests", "suggests_against", "proves_against", or "unrelated" as appropriate.
5. Use the provided bullet point IDs instead of including the full text of the bullet point.

Example of a bullet point not related to any hypothesis:
{{
  "text": "the butler likes sandwiches",
  "classifications": [
    {{
      "hypothesis_type": "none",
    }}
  ]
}}

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how each piece of evidence relates to the various hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime, or to indicate when a piece of evidence is unrelated to these hypotheses.
