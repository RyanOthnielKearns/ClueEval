I'm writing a murder mystery story. I've written up my story in the form of some bullet points, and I want to organize them.

Analyze the following story and classify each piece of evidence (bullet point) according to how it relates to the hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime. For each bullet point, determine if it proves, suggests, suggests against, or proves against any hypothesis.

I'm going to give you a list of facts about the story, and I want you to classify each of them according to the scheme I'm giving you.

Story:
{bullet_points}

Hypotheses:
Killers: {killers}
Weapons: {weapons}
Locations: {locations}

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{{
  "classified_evidence": [
    {{
      "id": "1",
      "classifications": [
        {{
          "hypothesis_type": "killer/weapon/location",
          "hypothesis_name": "Name of the specific hypothesis",
          "category": "proves/suggests/suggests_against/proves_against"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Important:
1. Include EVERY bullet point ID in the "classified_evidence" array.
2. For each bullet point, provide classifications for ALL relevant hypotheses it relates to.
3. If a bullet point doesn't relate to a specific hypothesis type, don't include a classification for that hypothesis type.
4. Use the categories "proves", "suggests", "suggests_against", or "proves_against" as appropriate.
5. Use the provided bullet point IDs instead of including the full text of the bullet point.

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of how each piece of evidence relates to the various hypotheses about the killer, weapon, and location of the crime.
